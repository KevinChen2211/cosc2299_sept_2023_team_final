## How to contribute!
Before you start to code you will need to create an issue and a ticket, this is done on the GitHub projects.

First to contribute you will need to create a branch, the naming convention is seen below:

`feature/{AREA}/{TICKET_NUMBER}_{DESCRIPTION}`

- NOTE: keep everything in lowercase

### AREA
